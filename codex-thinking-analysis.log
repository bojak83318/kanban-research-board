[GPT-5.1-CODEX-MAX ANALYSIS THINKING LOG]

**Planning test results extraction**
I'm preparing to parse test statuses from JSON results across multiple projects by iterating through nested arrays and extracting relevant sections using scripting, since only grep is available instead of rg.

**Inspecting deeper code structure**
I'm examining lines around 320–380 to understand the nesting and structure relevant for testing.

**Inspecting CSV parsing for item structure**
Examining csvParsing.js to understand item metadata.

**Identifying CSS minHeight test failure**
The test fails because the element sets height but not min-height, so computed minHeight stays 0 instead of 96px as expected; fixing requires explicitly setting min-height via class or inline style.

**Analyzing drag-and-drop failures on mobile WebKit**
The current drag-and-drop relies on HTML5 events unsupported on mobile Safari, causing tests to fail in WebKit mobile context due to lack of touch-based drag handling.

**Adjusting import parser to strip checkbox prefix**
I'm fixing the regex to remove the leading checkbox prefix before matching link text, avoiding double `[ ]` in output.

**Clarifying import parsing and drag-drop issues**
I'm refining import parsing to extract language tags cleanly (e.g., parsing '#lang/c' correctly). For drag-and-drop, I'm adjusting the Column placeholder styling to ensure min-height.

**Patching KanbanPage imports**
I'm updating KanbanPage.ts to use locator.dragTo for better stability.
